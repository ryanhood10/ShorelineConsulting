    {
      question: "What does custom programming cost?",
      answer: "The cost of custom programming varies based on the size of the project, but generally speaking, we bill at $120/hour. We always give estimates and quotes ahead of time and keep an open line of communication with our clients so they always know about any scope/cost changes before any additional work is done."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a project normally take?",
      answer: "The time frame for each development project depends on several factors. Itâ€™s based on the size of the project, the functionality being requested, and how quickly we get responses from you when requesting resources and approvals."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the process work?",
      answer: "For most projects, we break it down into phases: Strategy session, research & information gathering, design concepts/revisions, programming implementation, testing, and launch."
    },
    {
      question: "How does maintenance work?",
      answer: "Maintenance depends on the nature of the software. Some projects may not need updates for years, while others require regular updates. We create a custom solution that fits your needs."
    },
    {
      question: "What software tools do you use?",
      answer: "We often use WordPress due to its flexibility, but our development team has a diverse skill set and can adapt to the needs of just about any project."
